    "# LocalCart scenario part 2: Creating streaming pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "A web or mobile app will trigger events as a user navigates a web site. These clickstream events indicate when a customer logs in, adds something to a basket, completes an order, and logs out. The events are placed into configured Message Hub (Apache Kafka) that provides a scalable way to buffer the data before it is saved, analysed, and rendered. Using the instructions in [Notebook #1 - Creating a Kafka Producer of ClickStream events](https://github.com/wdp-beta/get-started/blob/master/notebooks/localcart-scenario-part-1.ipynb) we generate clickstream events for LocalCart and send them to Message Hub to show how data can be collected offline and streamed to the cloud later. A [Java app](https://localcartkafkaproducer.mybluemix.net/LocalCartKafkaProducer/) continuously feeds a simulated stream of events to Message Hub. \n",

    "\n",
    "[Example 1: Capturing clickstream events for real-time analysis](#intro_a). You can use streaming pipelines to performs event-based aggregation operations (calculate the number of currently open baskets and value of those baskets, ...) on the fly and store the results into a Redis database. The aggregated data can easily be visualized in real-time using web applications that monitor this database, as described in [Notebook#4:Visualize streaming data in a real-time dashboard](https://github.com/wdp-beta/get-started/blob/master/notebooks/localcart-scenario-part-4.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "[Example 2: Capturing clickstream events for static analysis](#intro_b). You can also use streaming pipelines to store clickstream events (as-is or in modified form) in flat files, which can be processed offline - either by batch processes or interactively, as outlined in [Notebook#3b: Analyze static clickstreams](https://github.com/wdp-beta/get-started/blob/master/notebooks/localcart-scenario-part-3b.ipynb).\n",
